/**
 * Manages a group of [SavedStateRegistryController]s that are all saved to and restored from a single
 * "parent" [SavedStateRegistryOwner].
 *
 * This class is designed to support a navigation container that owns a
 * [SavedStateRegistryController] for each of a set of navigation "frames", where a frame is
 * something that can be navigated to/from. A frame loosely consists of a [View][android.view.View]
 * as well as a [SavedStateRegistryOwner]/[SavedStateRegistryController] that is set on that view
 * via [androidx.savedstate.ViewTreeSavedStateRegistryOwner]. The view associated with the
 * controller is considered the "owning" view.
 *
 * To save a child registry to the parent registry, call [saveRegistryController]. This should be
 * done whenever the "navigation frame" associated with the child registry is about to be hidden,
 * and from the [onWillSave] callback. To restore a child registry, call
 * [restoreRegistryControllerIfReady]. This should be done when a navigation frame that was
 * previously hidden is being shown again, and from the [onRestored] callback. See the kdoc on these
 * methods and callbacks for more information.
 *
 * [attachToParentRegistry] should be called when the owning view is attached to a window, and
 * passed the parent registry. [detachFromParentRegistry] should be called when the view is
 * detached. See the kdoc on those methods for more information about what they do.
 *
 * @param onWillSave Called whenever the parent registry is performing a save operation. Provides an
 * opportunity to save any active child registries via [saveRegistryController].
 * @param onRestored Called as soon as this instance has been restored from a parent registry, after
 * [attachToParentRegistry] and the parent registry's lifecycle is in the `CREATED` state.
